# CS4430project
A Trash conglomorate of CS3500 projects mashed together to look like they were meant to be a CS4430 Project



Hello Regan,

Everything should be working properly. 

2 things left we need to do are:

Add items to wishlists
Remove items from wishlists

the config.php file and the required.php file are used to set up the connection to the online database, which Peter has set up and has gotten working great.


Both options can be executed from their respective links in the code.

User ID can be grabbed through $_SESSION['userID']


You should be able to just create 2 different php files, have them execute the sql statement, and then have them redirect to whatever page they're on.

If you just copy the top part of each page (the php code with all of the includes) you should be fine. 

If you have any questions about this please text us or email us.

Peter here: I edited the database file to get rid of those blocks
